#Skin Cancer Tumor Segmentation
Project Overview
This project focuses on extracting the region of interest (ROI) from multiple images, specifically detecting and segmenting skin cancer tumors. Using image processing techniques and machine learning, the goal is to isolate tumors for further analysis.

#Steps Involved
Preprocessing

#Load images and apply color space transformations (e.g., RGB to HSV).
Remove background noise and enhance contrast.
Segmentation

#Apply thresholding and contour detection.
Use clustering techniques like K-Means to segment the tumor region.
Feature Extraction

#Extract texture and shape features from the detected region.
Use GLCM (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix) for texture analysis.
Visualization & Analysis

#Display segmented images with marked tumor regions.
Generate statistical insights for further study.
Requirements
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
